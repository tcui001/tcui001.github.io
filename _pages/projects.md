description: My research interests are broadly in computational mathematics for scientific machine learning and data science. I develop mathematically rigorous computational methods for statistical inverse problems, data assimilation and uncertainty quantification. These methods aim to optimally learn hidden structures and driven factors of complex mathematical models from data for issuing certified model predictions and making risk-averse decisions.
