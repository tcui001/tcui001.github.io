[comment]: <> With backgrounds in applied mathematics and engineering, my research interest lies in the algorithmic interface between computational mathematics and statistical learning, with a specific My research focuses on advancing foundational computational methodologies for  uncertainty quantification, statistical learning, and inverse problems. focuses on integrating computational mathematics, statistical learning, and mathematical modelling for issuing credible model-based predictions and decisions. I develop scalable statistical inference tools for computational inverse problems and uncertainty quantification. I also develop multilevel methods and model reduction methods that enable the deployment of statistical learning algorithms in large-scale real-world applications such as subsurface flows and geophysics.

[comment]: <> Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[comment]: <> Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[comment]: <> Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
