### DIRT: a deep inverse Rosenblatt transport method {#dirt}

DIRT is a MATLAB package that uses functional tensor trains to construct order-preserving, self-reinforced transport maps. A newer version of the code (with significant updates in the interface) will be released in March 2023.

### FastFIns {#fins}

Fast Forward and Inverse problems solver (FastFIns) is a set of MATLAB code for accelerate the solution of inverse problems using likelihood-informed subspaces and data-driven model reduction. This package also contains a set of routines for defining high-order finite element discretization of PDEs.

A newer version of the code using fully object-oriented programming is under development.
